Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study.\n\nIn this study, we want to examine your ability to perceive duration â€” how long something lasts.\n\nThe task is simple. In each trial, you will see a black disc appear on the screen and then disappear. Actually, the disc will appear and disappear three times in each trial, and each time, it will last for the same amount of time. We want you to pay attention to how long the disc lasts. Get a sense of its duration. It is repeated three times in a trial to help you get an accurate sense of its duration.\n\nAfter the third time the disc disappears it will be your turn to report its duration. Press an hold down the spacebar. This will make a disc appear on the screen. Let go of the spacebar when you think your disc has been on the screen as long as the standard disc you saw on that trial. So the point is we want you to reproduce the duration that you experienced. Remember we want to know how long each of the three black discs lasted, not how long they lasted in all together. \n\nPress any key to continue to the next page. \n\n'

But if you go over, your disc will disappear on its own and you won't get any points on that trial. So you need to be as accurate as possible without going over to earn the max. If you collect a total of 300 points by the end, we will double the credit you get for the experiment.\n\nIf you're feeling uncomfortable, you can press ESC key any time to stop the experiment.\n\nPress any key you are ready to do some practice trials.\n\n"

Thank you for agreeing to participate in this study.\n\nIn this study, we want to examine your ability to perceive duration â€” how long something lasts.\n\nThe task is simple. In each trial, you will see a black disc appear on the screen and then disappear. There will be three such disks. We want you to pay attention to how long the last disc lasts. Get a sense of its duration.\n\nAfter the third time the disc disappears it will be your turn to report its duration. Press and hold down the spacebar. This will make a disc appear on the screen. Let go of the spacebar when you think your disc has been on the screen as long as the standard disc you saw on that trial. So the point is we want you to reproduce the duration that you experienced. \n\nPress any key to continue to the next page. \n\n'

But if you go over, your disc will disappear on its own and you won't get any points on that trial. So you need to be as accurate as possible without going over to earn the max. Each trial will be for 10 points. There are about 120 trials. If you collect a total of 650 points by the end, we will double the credit you get for the experiment.\n\nIf you're feeling uncomfortable, you can press ESC key any time to stop the experiment.\n\nPress any key you are ready to do some practice trials.\n\n"

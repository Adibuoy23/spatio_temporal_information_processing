This is the replication of the original Tse experiment, but in Jon Ian collaboration style:

People watched four disks on the screen. Three of them were standards. Fourth one could be either be an oddball, or a standard disk. They were asked to reproduce the duration of the last disk by pressing and holding the space bar. They were instructed to no go longer than the the duration of the disk. They were given a feedback stimulus as they reproduced the duration of the disk. The feedback stimulus was always a standard disk.

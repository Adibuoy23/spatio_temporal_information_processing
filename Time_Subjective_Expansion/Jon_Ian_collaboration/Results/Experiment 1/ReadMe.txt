This is the original Jon Ian collaboration experiment:

People watched three standard disks on the screen for varying durations. They were instructed to report the duration of the last disk. They were explicitly told that each disk lasts for the same duration. While they reported, they had a feedback stimulus. This could be either and oddball / standard disk.
